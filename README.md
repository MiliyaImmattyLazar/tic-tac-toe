### :page_facing_up: About
- How to play my game.
- Tic-tac-toe is a 2 player game.
- There are 9 boxes to fill up. If a player fill up one horizontel,diagonal or vertical row, that user will win the game.

## :pencil2:Planning & Problem Solving
- Created a 3 row 3 column grid as a game board
- Added Appropriate css stylig to the grid
- Player 1 and player 2 value assigned as X and 0.
- I will have to check the winning combinations. There are 8 winning combinations
- If any one of the winning condition is correct , then I have to check which user was it.
- Then player won message should be displayed
- Game over message will be printed if no winning combinations found in the grid.

## :rocket:Cool tech
- Programming languages
- JavaScript
- CSS
- HTML

## :scream:Bugs to fix :poop:
- value changes if i click again inside the box

## :sob: Lessons learnt
- I will add more css styling like animations to my game if i had time.
## :white_check_mark:Future features
- I would add a restart button to the game
- Will add a Text decoration to the winning pair
